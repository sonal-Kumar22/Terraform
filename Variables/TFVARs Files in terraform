TFVARs Files in terraform

These files contains all the variable values from which terraform can read the values instead of passing it using -var command in Terraform CLI
Note: this file should always be named as terraform.tfvars

first.tf file
variable userage {
      type = number
}

variable username {
    type = string
}

output userages {
     value = "My name is ${var.username} and my age is ${var.userage}"
}

terraform.tfvars file
userage = 30
username = "sonal"

Command : terraform plan
O/P: userages = "My name is sonal and my age is 30"

To change the tfvars file name and use that name - custom tfvars file

first.tf file
variable userage {
      type = number
}

variable username {
    type = string
}

output userages {
     value = "My name is ${var.username} and my age is ${var.userage}"
}

terraform.tfvars file
userage = 30
username = "sonal"

development.tfvars file
userage = 10
username = "Komal Kumar"

command : terrafrom plan -var-file=development.tfvars
O/p: userages = "My name is Komal Kumar and my age is 10"
