Multiple Variables

If the default value of variable is set like 
variables.tf
variable username {
    default = "World"
}

Output.tf
output printname {
       value = "Hello, ${var.username}"
}

In here, if we run terraform plan then output will be
- printname = "Hello, World"

And if we run command by passing value then,terraform plan -var "username=Sonal Kumar"
- printname = "Hello, Sonal Kumar"

so, terraform will ask value only when the value is not assigned, here value of username is not asked because in case value is not given then default
value should be considered that is World

Example of multiple variables
variables.tf file
variable username {
    default = "World"
}

variable age {}

Output.tf file
output printname {
       value = "Hello, ${var.username}. Your age is ${var.age}"
}

Run command : terraform plan -var "username=AK singh" -var "age=23"
