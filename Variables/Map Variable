Map Variable example:

var.tf
variable userages {
      type = map
      default = {
          sonal = 22
          kommal = 26
      }
}

output.tf 
output usrages {
     value = "My name is sonal and my age is ${lookup(var.userages,"sonal")}"
}

Command: terraform plan
O/P: usrages = "My name is sonal and my age is 22"

Note: here if we want to print komal, then we need to change the name sonal to komal from both places in output.tf file
We can resolve this by: using map variable Dynamically

How to use map variable Dynamically
var.tf
variable userages {
      type = map
      default = {
          sonal = 22
          komal = 26
      }
}

variable usernames {
    type = string
}

created a new variable named "usernames"

Output.tf
output usrages {
     value = "My name is ${var.usernames} and my age is ${lookup(var.userages,var.usernames)}"
}

Command: terraform plan
ar.usernames
  Enter a value: sonal
  usrages = "My name is sonal and my age is 22"
