1.Create a variable.tf file
- vi hello-variable.tf

File contents:
->
variable username {}

output printname {
       value = "Hello, ${var.username}"
}

here a variable block named username has been created which will store the value passed by the user upon running the terraform plan command.
the output block will print the Hello message with the username passed by the user above.
OR
We can segrigate this into 2 different files:
- variables.tf
variable username {}

-output.tf
output printname {
       value = "Hello, ${var.username}"
}


2.Run terraform plan command
- it will ask to enter the username value to pass in variable
then the output block will print the line hello username value passed.

Pass variable value from command
-> terraform plan -var "username=Sonal Kumar"
with this command we would need not provide user value separately, it will be passed through this one command itself.
