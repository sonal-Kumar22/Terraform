Terraform provides 3 types of provisioners:
- file
- local-exec
- remote-exec

So if we want to put a text file like readme.txt inside the EC2 instance we use provisioner. From local to remote machine 
The file provisioner is used to copy files or directories from the machine executing Terraform to the newly created resource. 

We'll cover "file" here
